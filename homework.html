    Giant pandas have a striking black-and-white coat, with black patches around their eyes, ears, legs, and
    shoulders. They have a round face and a bulky body, with adults weighing between 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and
    measuring about 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) in length.
